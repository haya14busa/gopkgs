gopkgs outputs list of importable Go packages.

By using the same implementation as [goimports](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports),
it's faster than [go list ...](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-List_packages) and it also has `-f` option.

gopkgs cares .goimportsignore which was introduced by https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16386
since it uses the same implementation as [goimports](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports).

Sample usage of gopkgs with other tools like [godoc](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc) and filtering tools ([peco](https://github.com/peco/peco)).

### Installation

#### Install Binary from GitHub Releases

https://github.com/haya14busa/gopkgs/releases

#### go get

```
go get -u github.com/haya14busa/gopkgs/cmd/gopkgs
```

### SYNOPSIS

```
$ gopkgs -h
Usage of gopkgs:
  -f string
        alternate format for the output using the syntax of template package. e.g. {{.Name}};{{ImportPathShort}}
  -fullpath
        output absolute file path to package directory. ("/usr/lib/go/src/net/http")
  -include-name
        fill Pkg.Name which can be used with -f flag
  -short
        output vendorless import path ("net/http", "foo/bar/vendor/a/b") (default true)


Use -f to custom the output using template syntax. The struct being passed to template is:
    type Pkg struct {
        Dir             string // absolute file path to Pkg directory ("/usr/lib/go/src/net/http")
        ImportPath      string // full Pkg import path ("net/http", "foo/bar/vendor/a/b")
        ImportPathShort string // vendorless import path ("net/http", "a/b")

        // It can be empty. It's filled only when -include-name flag is true.
        Name string // package name ("http")
    }

```

### Vim

![gopkgs_vim.gif (890×542)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haya14busa/i/3bdf4c81118c4f0261073a7f3144903623240edc/gopkgs/gopkgs_vim.gif)

Sample usage of gopkgs in Vim: open godoc and import with [vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go) and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

```vim
function! s:get_go_pkgs()
    function! s:go_import(pk)
        execute 'GoImport' a:pk
    endfunction
    call fzf#run(fzf#wrap({'source': 'gopkgs | sort | uniq', 'sink': function('s:go_import')}))
endfunction
function! s:get_go_doc()
    function! s:go_doc(pk)
        execute 'GoDoc' a:pk
    endfunction
    call fzf#run(fzf#wrap({'source': 'gopkgs | sort | uniq', 'sink': function('s:go_doc')}))
endfunction
augroup gopkgs
    autocmd!
    autocmd FileType go command! -buffer GI exe s:get_go_pkgs()
    autocmd FileType go command! -buffer GD exe s:get_go_doc()
augroup END
```
